In 1972, at the age of 81, she became the first African American woman to have a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. She even had three exhibitions of her paintings at the White House. Alma began painting seriously after retiring as an art teacher in Washington, D.C. in 1960. Her art is known for its abstract color and form experiments, which are her signature style.[</p>
